Have you ever wanted to create your personal webpage? Did you know that it can be done for FREE? Today we will learn how to create a website for free in a very short time.
We will be using [github](https://github.com/) where we will host our webpage.

## Register for a github account
Create an account on: [github](https://github.com)
1. Sign up for Github

## Login to github
Once you verify your email address, login to github.

## Fork a template repo
Here we are using a free [beautiful-jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) template from the wonderful [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/).
First thing, we want to do is **fork** the beautiful-jekyll repository. This creates a copy of the repository on our Github account.

Once the forking is complete, the repo will be inside your github account.

## Rename the forked repo
Now we need to rename the **forked** repository to our _username.github.io_. Click Settings then rename the repository to _username.github.io_. In my case, I am changing it to _rbiology.github.io_

Now our website is ready.

## View webpage
We can view it at _username.github.io_ For me, it will be [rbiology.github.io](https://rbiology.github.io)

Before doing this, we want to edit some parts and personalize the website.

## Editing webpages
First, edit the details on _\_config.yml_ file. Scroll down the repository and open _\_config.yml_ by clicking it.

Change the Title of the page and Description of the page.

## Commit the changes

Then click Commit.

Now we have completed editing a part of our page. 

Our website is already published and I can view the changes by going to _username.github.io_ For me it will be, [rbiology.github.io](https://rbiology.github.io)

The file: _index.html_ is the first page that will be shown when you go to your website. You can edit the details of the page as you like.

## Create new posts
You can edit or create new blog posts by going into _\_posts_ directory. These will be displayed on the homepage accordingly.
The website follows **markdown** syntax. Click [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to learn more about markdown syntax.

You can edit other parts of the page in a similar way to suit your website according to your needs.

Some websites created by using beautiful-jekyll template are as follows:
