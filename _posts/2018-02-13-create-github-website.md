Create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your Github username. If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right. Here, our repository will be in: rbiology.github.io Readme is for documentation

#Here we are using a free beautiful-jekyll template from the wonderful Dean Attali available at: https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll
First thing, we want to do is FORK the beautiful-jekyll repository. This creates a copy of the repository on our Github account:
20_deanatliFork
Once, this is complete, we should rename the repository to our username.github.io
Click Settings then rename the repository to username.github.io. In my case, I am changing it to rbiology.github.io
23-24
Now our website is ready at rbiology.github.io
And we can edit the details by editing the _config.yml file. Scroll down the repository and open _config.yml by clicking it.
Now click on the pencil to edit

Change the Title of the page and Description of the page.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and commit a description for your change

Then click Commit.
Now we have completed editing for our page. 
Our website is already published and I can view the changes by going to username.github.io For me it will be, rbiology.github.io

You can edit other parts of the page in a similar way to suit your website according to your needs.
The file: index.html is the first page that will be shown when you go to rbiology.github.io
You can edit or create new posts by going into _posts directory. These will be displayed on the homepage accordingly.

Some websites created by using beautiful-jekyll template are as follows:

http://chauff.github.io/
