## Installing and loading packages

### Installing packages
Packages are collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format. The directory where packages are stored is called the library. R comes with a standard set of packages. Others are available for download and installation. Once installed, they have to be loaded into the session to be used.
For most data wrangling processes, we will _tidyverse_ and _agricolae_ packages.
We will first install these packages:
```r
install.packages("agricolae")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

_tidyverse_ tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science including _dplyr_, _ggplot2_, _tidyr_, etc.. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
_agricolae_ package contains functionality for the Statistical Analysis of experimental designs applied specially for field experiments in agriculture and plant breeding.

### Loading packages

Installation of packages need to be done only once, after which we can load the packages that are installed by:

```r
library(agricolae)
library(tidyverse)
```
