#### Load packages and data:


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

```r
irisdata <- read_csv("irisdata.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   Sepal.Length = col_double(),
##   Sepal.Width = col_double(),
##   Petal.Length = col_double(),
##   Petal.Width = col_double(),
##   Species = col_character()
## )
```
Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the _split-apply-combine_ paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **_dplyr_** makes this very easy through the use of the **group_by()** function.
**group_by()** is often used together with **summarize()**, which collapses each group into a single-row summary of that group. **group_by()** takes as arguments the column names that contain the categorical variables for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute the mean Sepal.Length by Species:


```r
irisdata %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  summarize(Mean_Length = mean(Sepal.Length))
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   Species    Mean_Length
##   <chr>            <dbl>
## 1 setosa            5.01
## 2 versicolor        5.94
## 3 virginica         6.59
```


#### Tallying
To know the number of observations found for each factor or combination of factors, we can use **tally()**. For example, if we wanted to group by _Species_ and find the number of rows of data for each _Species_, we would do:

```r
irisdata %>% 
  group_by(Species) %>% 
  tally()
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 2
##   Species        n
##   <chr>      <int>
## 1 setosa        50
## 2 versicolor    50
## 3 virginica     50
```

Here, **tally()** is the action applied to the groups created by **group_by()** and counts the total number of records for each category.


#### Dealing with missing data
Missing data is coded by _NA_ in R. If we want to remove those, we could insert a **filter()** in the chain: **is.na()** is a function that determines whether something is an _NA_. The **!** symbol negates the result. So, if we want to get every row, where _Sepal.Length_ is not an _NA_, we can do the following:

```r
irisdata %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Sepal.Length)) %>% 
  mutate(Sepal.Length_mm = Sepal.Length*10) %>% 
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Length_mm) %>% 
  head()
```

```
## Warning: package 'bindrcpp' was built under R version 3.3.3
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Length_mm
##   <chr>          <dbl>           <dbl>
## 1 setosa          5.10            51.0
## 2 setosa          4.90            49.0
## 3 setosa          4.70            47.0
## 4 setosa          4.60            46.0
## 5 setosa          5.00            50.0
## 6 setosa          5.40            54.0
```

### Exporting data

We can use the function **write_csv** in order to export data.
First, create a new dataframe to export.

```r
setosadata <- irisdata %>%
  filter(Species=="Setosa") %>%
  select(Species, Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)
```
Now, export this new dataframe:

```r
write_csv(setosadata, path="output/setosadata.csv")
```
